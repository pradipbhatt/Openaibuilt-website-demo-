    <p>Hi everyone, my name is Pradip Bhatt and I am a third semester computer science and engineering student from Far Western University. I am passionate about participating in hackathons and using my skills and knowledge to come up with creative solutions. <br><br><br>

        I have experience working on website projects and have developed a database management system in my last semester, as well as a project for the Society of Engineering Students (SOES) at fwusoes.com. I have a strong interest in front-end web design and have recently been learning Python, where I was able to build an AI model.<br><br><br>
        
        However, as a student from the farthest part of Nepal, I face challenges such as limited access to networking and job opportunities, as well as a lack of local communities, workshops, and events to support my development and growth in the field. This hackathon presents a unique opportunity for me to gain exposure to the IT industry and share my experience with others in my college and community.<br><br><br>
        
        I am eager to participate in this hackathon and make the most of this opportunity to learn and collaborate with others, but I do face financial constraints that may make it difficult for me to attend such events. I hope that this introduction conveys my enthusiasm and passion for technology, and I am grateful for the opportunity to apply for this hackathon. Thank you for considering my application</p>
